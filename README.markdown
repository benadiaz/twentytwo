## What's TwentyTwo?

TwentyTwo is a Mac OS X application which brings
[22tracks](http://22tracks.com) to the
desktop without using a browser.

Why is that good?

- No more 'trying to find in which tab is 22tracks running'..
- Media keys support! (Yeah, those with ▶ ❚❚ on them.)
- Stops on suspend.


## Download?

Yes, this is available here: https://github.com/marcw/twentytwo/raw/master/dist/TwentyTwo.dmg
